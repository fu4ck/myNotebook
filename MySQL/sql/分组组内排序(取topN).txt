how would you get the 2 oldest people in each group?
+--------+-------+-----+
| Person | Group | Age |
+--------+-------+-----+
| Bob    | 1     | 32  |
| Jill   | 1     | 34  |
| Shawn  | 1     | 42  |
| Jake   | 2     | 29  |
| Paul   | 2     | 36  |
| Laura  | 2     | 39  |
+--------+-------+-----+

result：
+--------+-------+-----+
| Shawn  | 1     | 42  |
| Jill   | 1     | 34  |
| Laura  | 2     | 39  |
| Paul   | 2     | 36  |

1、row_number
select person, `group`, age
from 
(
   select person, `group`, age,
      (@num:=if(@group = `group`, @num +1, if(@group := `group`, 1, 1))) row_number 
  from test t
  CROSS JOIN (select @num:=0, @group:=null) c
  order by `Group`, Age desc, person
) as x 
where x.row_number <= 2;


2. 使用union(组多时就有点可怕了)
(
  select *
  from mytable 
  where `group` = 1
  order by age desc
  LIMIT 2
)
UNION ALL
(
  select *
  from mytable 
  where `group` = 2
  order by age desc
  LIMIT 2
)


3. count
SELECT a.person, a.group, a.age FROM person AS a WHERE 
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM person AS b 
WHERE b.group = a.group AND b.age >= a.age) <= 2 
ORDER BY a.group ASC, a.age DESC




-------------------------下面的写法是不对的----------------------
select * from  
(select   
 version,time  
from   
  table  
order by time desc) t  
group by version  
order by time desc 


select * from  
(select   
 version,time  
from   
  table  
order by time desc) t  
group by version  
order by time desc limit 5
