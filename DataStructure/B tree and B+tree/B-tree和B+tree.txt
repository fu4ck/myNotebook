为什么用B+tree？
因为一个磁盘块的大小有限(4k左右)，
非叶子节点不存data的话，一个节点便可存储更多的key，
一次IO便能查询到更多的数据

B+tree只有叶子节点存储data，
并且把叶子节点用指针连接起来（链表），也方便范围查找

Advantages of B+ trees:
Because B+ trees don't have data associated with interior nodes, more keys can fit on a page of memory.
Therefore, it will require fewer cache misses in order to access data that is on a leaf node.

The leaf nodes of B+ trees are linked, so doing a full scan of all objects in a tree requires just one linear pass through all the leaf nodes. 
A B tree, on the other hand, would require a traversal of every level in the tree. 
This full-tree traversal will likely involve more cache misses than the linear traversal of B+ leaves.
